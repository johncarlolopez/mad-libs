Fighting evil by night, winning love by day
Never running from a baddie, she is the one named moon-girl.

She will never turn her back on her friend.
She is always there to defend.
She is the one in whom we can depend.

She is the one named Sailorrrrrr ...

Sailor girl!
Sailor man!
Sailor Mars!
Sailor Jupiter!

With secret powers all so new to her
She is the one... Sailor Moon!
